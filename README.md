# Face-Recognition

Here I have created a program in Python that allows one to use his devices webcam and detects similarities in the form of percentages compared to the images that are given to the program. For instance, the images that I have given to the program in a director include png's of Elon Musk, Lebron James, Priyanka Chopra, and Lionel Messi. If any of these individuals were to come in front of the camera that is run once the program is executed, a percentage of similarity will be displayed typically 90% and above. The program can also work on myself if I were to give the directory an image of me. Additionally, it will work show similarity percenatges if there are multiple faces in the frame as well. If the face is not provided in the directory is in the camera frame, the similarity percentage will be relatively low, typically below 30%. This program can be used as cyber tool along with many other implementations in the real world.

In order to run this program, make sure that your webcam has access to pycharms, and that the following are installed using the terminal: dlib (My version was dlib==19.23), opencv-python, face_recognition. This way, the libraries used in my program will be accessed and implemented. 

Thank you!
